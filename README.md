# LAMetroBikeShare

Los Angeles just launched its Metro Bike Share system at the beginning of Q3, 2016. The system consisted of over 60 stations and 1,000 bicycles( find more information from [the original website](https://bikeshare.metro.net/)). There are currently 3 pricing options for the service; Monthly Pass, Flex Pass, and Walk-up. It also released the [system usage dataset](https://bikeshare.metro.net/about/data/) for the recent quarter(Jul - Sep, 2016). This project aims at exploring the usage statistics and the overall trend.


The project site is hosted [here](http://www-scf.usc.edu/~nakarese/LAMetroBikeShare/).
